Revision history for Test::Pod::Coverage

1.08    Wed Jan 25 21:59:49 CST 2006
        [FIXES]
        * File and directory names may now contain periods and hyphens.
        * Now exports all_modules().

1.07_01 Wed Dec 28 23:10:31 CST 2005
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Can now use an alternate class that implements the Pod::Coverage
          interface.  This is mostly useful for avoiding the necessity to
          redocument or itemize overriden methods in a subclass by using
          Pod::Coverage::CountParents.  Thanks to Ricardo Signes.

1.06    Tue Jun 22 16:51:42 CDT 2004
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        * Looks in blib/ if there is one, otherwise looks in lib/
        * Doesn't report "no public symbols" unless verbose mode is on.
        * Thanks to David Wheeler and Shawn Sorichetti for nudging.
          This behavior will be in Test::Pod soon, too.

        * Now says what module has a problem if it can't find any
          POD.  Thanks, Barbie.

        [INTERNALS]
        * Added a couple more tests to bring my test coverage up
          to 100%, according to Devel::Cover.  Whoo!

0.02
        First version with the new reasonable API on pod_coverage_ok().
